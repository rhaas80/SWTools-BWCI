<h2>Description</h2>

<a href="http://www.einsteintoolkit.org/">Einstein Toolkit</a> 
The Einstein Toolkit currently consists of an open set of over 100 Cactus
thorns for computational relativity along with associated tools for simulation
management and visualization. The toolkit includes a vacuum spacetime solver
(McLachlan), a relativistic hydrodynamics solver (formerly the public version
of the Whisky code, but now heavily extended), along with thorns for initial
data, analysis and computational infrastructure. These thorns have been
developed and improved over many years by many different researchers.

<h2>Use</h2>
<p>
NAMD is available as a <a href="/computing-resources/modules">module</a>.
The modulefile for NAMD sets up the necessary environmental variables
for NAMD and updates PATH to include NAMD executables.
<p>
The executable <b>namd2</b> is available upon loading of the module 
and may be used inside
<a href="/computing-resources/darter/running_jobs#batch-scripts">
job submission scripts</a>:

<pre>
module load namd
aprun -n [nprocs] namd2 [other arguments]
</pre>
